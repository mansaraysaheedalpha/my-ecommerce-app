# ADR 0001: Admin Panel Architecture Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to build a world-class admin panel for SaloneAmazon e-commerce platform that:
- Scales with business growth
- Maintains high security standards
- Provides real-time insights
- Is maintainable by a team

## Decision
We will implement a modular monolith architecture with:

1. **Backend**:
   - Dedicated admin routes (`/api/admin/...`)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) middleware
   - Audit logging for all admin actions
   - Separate admin controllers/services

2. **Frontend**:
   - Separate bundle/build for admin panel
   - Dynamic route loading based on permissions
   - Admin-specific Redux slice
   - Shared component library where appropriate

3. **Database**:
   - Same MongoDB instance but with separate collections:
     - `admin_audit_logs`
     - `admin_settings`
   - Enhanced indexes for admin queries

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Easier to secure admin-specific endpoints
  - Better performance for admin-specific queries
  - Can scale to microservices later if needed

- **Cons**:
  - Slightly more complex initial setup
  - Need to maintain some duplication between regular and admin APIs
